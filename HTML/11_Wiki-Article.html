      The Scarlet Witch is a fictional character appearing in American comic
      books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist
      Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in The X-Men #4 in March 1964, in
      the Silver Age of Comic Books. Originally described as having the power to
      alter probability, the Scarlet Witch evolved into a powerful sorceress by
      the 1980s. Over time, she has occasionally tapped into immense magical
      forces, allowing her to alter reality itself. She is widely recognized as
      one of Marvelâ€™s most powerful heroes.

      The Scarlet Witch, an alter ego of Wanda Django Maximoff, was first
      introduced as a reluctant supervillain alongside her twin brother,
      Quicksilver, both founding members of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. A
      year later, she joined the Avengers and became a longtime member of
      various teams like the West Coast Avengers and Force Works. In 1975, she
      married her android teammate Vision and magically conceived twin sons.
      Their tragic loss in 1989, along with Vision's emotional reset, led to
      their marriage's end and fueled major storylines like Avengers:
      Disassembled and House of M. Her sons, Wiccan and Speed, would later
      return as teenage heroes.

      Originally depicted as a mutant, later stories revealed her powers stem
      from experiments by the High Evolutionary, combined with inherited magical
      abilities. A 2015 retcon clarified she was never truly a mutant but gave a
      false-positive on 'X-gene" tests.[9] Wanda's origins have changed over
      time: initially unnamed parents, later Golden Age heroes Whizzer and Miss
      America, and then Magneto and Magda. Eventually, it was revealed she is
      the daughter of Natalya Maximoff, a Roma sorceress and previous Scarlet
      Witch, with Django and Marya Maximoff as her aunt and uncle.

      prominent appearances in WandaVision (2021) and Doctor Strange in the
